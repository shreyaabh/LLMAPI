    "\n",
    "<strong>Challenge 1: The Treasure Hunt</strong>\n",
    "Alex and Lily embarked on a treasure hunt that led them to a mysterious cave. Inside the cave, they found a locked chest with a riddle written on it. The riddle stated, \"To open the chest, find the least number that is a multiple of 4, 6, and 8.\" Remembering their lessons on LCM, Alex and Lily quickly calculated the LCM of 4, 6, and 8, which turned out to be 24. They used the number to unlock the chest and discovered a map to the hidden treasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Challenge 2: The Magical Bridge</strong>\n",
    "As they continued their adventure, Alex and Lily encountered a magical bridge guarded by a mystical creature. The creature challenged them to find the least number of steps that would cause the bridge to light up. The steps were numbered 5, 7, and 9. Applying their knowledge of LCM, Alex and Lily calculated the LCM of 5, 7, and 9, which turned out to be 315. As they took 315 steps, the bridge lit up, allowing them to cross safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Challenge 3: The Enchanted Garden</strong>\n",
    "In the final challenge, Alex and Lily entered an enchanted garden filled with beautiful flowers. They were tasked with arranging the flowers in rows, with each row containing 12, 15, and 18 flowers. Using the concept of LCM, they determined that they needed 180 flowers to fill each row without any flowers left over. The garden bloomed with vibrant colors, and the siblings completed their adventure successfully.\n",
